HOW TO USE THE GUI:
A default 5x5 mesh is already provided for you as well as a selected vertex.
- 	To make a new mesh, simply input its size into the input boxs at the top. "Rows" and
"Cols" represent how many quads are in the mesh. The "Unit Width" and "Unit Height"
input boxes define how big a single quad unit is. Click "Create Mesh" after typing in 
the values you want.
-	The color of the mesh can be changed by useing the three colored sliders under
the "Create Mesh" button.
-	You can also change the camera's position by using the "wasd" keys, or by clicking
on one for the buttons under "View"
-	To select another vertex, click on the arrow-buttons below "Select Vertex". This
will cycle through all the verticies. The currently selected vertex will be surrounded by
a small maroon box, so that it's easy to spot. You can change its height, as well as the
snowcap color height, with the sliders below.
-	The "No. of Subivisions" input box and button do nothing at the moment, unfortunately. 

DIFFICULTIES:
	I had the hardest time figuring out how to draw the mesh. Using classes for Face, 
Edge, and Vertex, I took forever creating a mesh-creation algorithm through trial and error.
That is literally what took all of my time. In the end, I managed to finish everything 
except any of the smoothing/fractalizing methods. 

KNOWN ERRORS:
	From what I was able to test, there aren't any big errors. The snowcap level can sometimes seem
like it's not working, but it is!
